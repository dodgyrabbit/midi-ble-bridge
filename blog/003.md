# Some thoughts

* The Async approach seems to make sense if we're consuming a service.
* If we are exporting a service, then Async does not seem to make sense, since we get called and process the request when we get the message. It's async from the "other" side's perspective. Unless of course the method does IO or something.

 * sudo btmon
 * Enable verbose logging probably required:

 * https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingBluetooth

When publishing services, does it even make sense to have an interface which is then implemented? I guess it's nice but the Attributes are not inherited so have to apply that anywyas.

The deeper question is then, exactly what does it do for Tmds.Dbus if you implement 
` [DBusInterface("???")]` ??

## Disconnect

Looks like it may be as simple as sending this message:
